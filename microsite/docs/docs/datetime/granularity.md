# Granularity

```scala mdoc:silent
// this is here to remove noisy warnings
import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll
```

If you wish to restrict the precision of the generated instances, this library refers to that as _granularity_.

You can constrain the granularity to:

  * Seconds
  * Minutes
  * Hours
  * Days
  * Years

When a value is constrained, the time fields are set to zero, and the rest to the first day of the month, or day of the year. For example, if you constrain a field to be years, the generated instance will be midnight exactly, on the first day of January.

To constrain a generated type, you simply need to provide an import for the typeclass for your date/time and range, and also an import for the granularity. As an example, this time using Java SE 8's `java.time` package:

```scala mdoc:silent
import java.time._
import com.fortysevendeg.scalacheck.datetime.jdk8.ArbitraryJdk8._
import com.fortysevendeg.scalacheck.datetime.jdk8.granularity.years

val prop = forAll { (zdt: ZonedDateTime) =>
  (zdt.getMonth == Month.JANUARY) &&
  (zdt.getDayOfMonth == 1) &&
  (zdt.getHour == 0) &&
  (zdt.getMinute == 0) &&
  (zdt.getSecond == 0) &&
  (zdt.getNano == 0)
}

prop.check()
```
